# SandRipples
codes for saltation ripple forming problems

</p> The code titled FixedAngleBombardmentRipples.m takes a landscape of sand with some small intial unevenness, and bombards it with a rain of windblown sand particles all impacting at the same angle but hitting the bed at different, evenly spaced location. Each "shot" of particles has some number of grains in it, and there are a total number of "shots" fired throughout the course of the simulation. These parameters are specified in the code. The model assume uniform grain size, and a fixed number of net ejected particles from each impact point, and a fixed distance that those particles move.</p>
<p> Further additions to the model would be to incorporate some variation in distance moved or net particles ejected. I just haven't had time for that yet. </p>
